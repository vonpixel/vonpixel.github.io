Lead 3D Artist
Dapphaus
Date 2020 - 2024
https://productionimage.jpg 
As the lead 3D artist at Dapphaus my role was to oversee a small team of artists and work with the developer team and meet with clients and develop creative direction of various projects. I would manage a small team of artists and create 3D assets and other artworks ranging from concept art to beyond. With the development team we would work together to identify the needs of the project and come up with solutions and techniques. I also served as a technical artist developing workflows and methods for meeting optimization challenges. With clients I would meet to help scope out the art side of the project and travel to work sites to gather reference images or learn how to operate machines so our digital twins would look correct. I was also responsible for contributing to pre production planning and figuring out scope to delegate to our small team.
