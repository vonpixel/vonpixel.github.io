Lead 3D Artist
Dapphaus
Date 2020 - 2024
dapphaus_logo.jpg 
As the lead 3D artist at Dapphaus my role was to oversee a small team of artists and work with the developer team and meet with clients and develop creative direction of various projects. I managed a small team of artists and created 3D assets and other artworks ranging from concept art to 3D models / animations and simulations. With the development team we would work together to identify the needs of the project and come up with solutions and techniques. I also served as a technical artist developing workflows and methods for meeting optimization challenges related to WebGL and VR. With clients I would meet to help scope out the art side of the project and travel to work sites to gather reference images and 3d scans (Lidar / photogrammetry) or learn how to operate machines so our digital twins would look correct. I was also responsible for contributing to pre production planning and figuring out scope to delegate to our small team.
