Hello! I am a digital and 3D artist who has worked for over 15 in film / vfx and game development. I started out as a colorist / vfx artist and worked on multiple feature films / music videos and commercials eventually transitioning into a freelance motion graphics artist. I continued to work on broadcast desgin and visual effects until my hobby of learning Unity engine found me the oppertunity of working in game development. 


I spent the next 8 years working on training and heavy industry applications in Unity targeting desktop / web and VR deployment as a lead / prinicpal 3D artist at Kearns Technology and Dapphaus.
