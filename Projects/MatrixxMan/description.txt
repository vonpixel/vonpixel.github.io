Matrixxman - Identity Crisis 
---
Ten mini music videos for Matrixxman's Identity Crisis album. This was a very fun and ambitious project. Usually his music is straight techno but Identity Crisis was a departure in sound venturing in UK Garage / Dub Step and Bass. To coincide with the albums release I created ten mini music videos running roughly 60 seconds each. Each video aimed to set a mood and vibe embracing a dark gritty cyberpunk aesthetic.
