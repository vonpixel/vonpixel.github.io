Nite Snack 20XX

A personal project to create a short moody cinematic about my Shawarma Mech stomping around a city searching from hungry people in the night. The real goal behind the project was a way to dip my toes deeper into UE5 and explore work flows with it and to test out what my new 3080ti card could push out.
