Safety Meta World Environments
---
Safety Meta World is an upcoming safety training online "metaverse" designed to take users through a large number of training modules. Users can enter a hub campus where they can choose their lessons, review content and customize their avatars. The project runs in webGL in the browser and required a large amount of optimization to hit performance targets. There was a very fast turn around on this project with approx 6 months dedicated to all art / animation and level creation so that the learning content team could implement the lessons.
