Elesim Training Environment 
---
Elesim was a training program developed to aid in training elevator and escalator technicians and union members. I was responsible for all 3d art on the project from the environment to the props and assets used. There was a large amount of technical information that had to be digested and understood before work could even begin. The environment was requested to be giant office building in a downtown location that could eventually house multiple types of elevators and escalators. Development of the environment also had to be able to serve a dual purpose of being able to run on low end machines and be VR friendly while aiming at being the "Call Of Duty of elevator repair".
